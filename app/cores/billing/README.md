# Billing Core

Use this README to provide some general information about the core you are about
to build and which will help future developers to get started with a warm welcome, yay!


## What to write?

Some very important things you may want to cover:

- Does this core come with a Billing:: namespace, or is it top level?

- What is the purpose and business logic of each model?

- What are the important gotchas that every developer should know before starting to work on this core?

- What are the things to do, improve or be aware of?

- What are the gems that support this core, and what do they do?
